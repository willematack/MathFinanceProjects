# Mathematical Finance Projects

This repo contains my term projects from my Mathematical Finance course (each was with a different group). The projects aim to mix mathematical theory delivered in the class, with coding implementations. I compiled all the code in each part into a single notebook. Each part of the project is documented in an academic style report. It is in two parts:

## [American Options](https://github.com/willematack/MathFinanceProjects/blob/main/AmericanOptionsReport.pdf)
This part uses discrete-time models to price American options, and compute decision their decision boundaries. In addition, a hedging strategy is derived and implemented. The profit distribution, and early exercise statistics are computed under varying market conditions (i.e. market volatility, drift, etc...). 

For example, here is the decision boundaries for an "at the money" option under varying market volatilies and rates, along with some sample paths in these environments:

## [Delta Gamma Hedging Simulation](https://github.com/willematack/MathFinanceProjects/blob/main/DeltaGammaHedgingReport.pdf)
This part uses Black Scholes model to price European options. Delta hedging and delta-gamma hedging strategies are implemented. The profit distribution of each strategy are analyzed under varying market conditions, and in the presence of transaction costs.

For example, this visualization shows the Profit/Loss distribution of an option position when delta hedging, and delta-gamma hedging strategies are followed (with transaction costs) when realized volatilities vary (implied volatility remains constant).
