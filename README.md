This repo contains my term project from my Mathematical Finance course. The projects aim to mix mathematical theory delivered in the class, with coding implementations. I compiled all the code in each part into a single notebook. Each part of the project is documented in an academic style report. It is in two parts:

AmericanOptions - uses discrete models to price American options, and compute decision their decision boundaries. In addition, a hedging strategy is derived and implemented. The profit distribution, and early exercise statistics are computed under varying market conditions (i.e. market volatility, drift, etc...)

DeltaGammaHedging - uses Black Scholes model to price European options. Delta hedging and delta-gamma hedging strategies are implemented. The profit distribution of each strategy are analyzed under varying market conditions, and in the presence of transaction costs.
